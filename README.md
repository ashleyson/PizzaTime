# PizzaTime
A program that will manage incoming pizza orders. All pizza orders have an associated time representing when the customer expects to have their pizza ready 
(itâ€™s possible for a customer to call ahead and schedule a later pickup time). 
All pizza orders will be managed by a MinHeap where the next order to prepare is the one that is the earliest compared to the other orders.
